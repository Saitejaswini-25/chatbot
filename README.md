# My Figma-Bolt Project

This project showcases my skills in UI/UX design and front-end development. I designed the user interface using **Figma** and implemented it using **Bolt**, with the front-end code written in **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The application answers basic questions based on the user inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: UI/UX design tool used for creating the initial layout.
- **Bolt**: Front-end framework for building the structure of the web page.
- **TypeScript**: Used for adding type safety to the JavaScript code.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language used for dynamic behavior.
- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the content.
- **CSS**: Styling language used for the layout and visual design.

## Project Features

- **Interactive Question-Answer Functionality**: The application answers basic questions input by the user.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Modern Design**: Designed with a clean, modern look using Figma and implemented with a focus on user experience.
